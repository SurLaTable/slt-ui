## Getting started:

If you just want to hack on components, you can run:

```
yarn install
yarn sandbox
```

Use `sandbox/index.js` as your app entry point. That will use your local components (and transpile them on the fly). This way you can adjust the components and see the changes after saving.

We are working on bringing hot module replacement to the sandbox.

You can also hack on our components using CodeSandbox:
